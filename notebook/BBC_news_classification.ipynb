    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text documents** are one of the richest sources of data for businesses. This project focuses on building an automated news classification system using machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a **public dataset from the BBC** comprised of **2,225 articles**, each labeled under one of **5 categories**:\n",
    "- **Business**\n",
    "- **Entertainment** \n",
    "- **Politics**\n",
    "- **Sport**\n",
    "- **Tech**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Details |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **Total Articles** | 2,225 |\n",
    "| **Training Set** | 1,490 records |\n",
    "| **Testing Set** | 735 records |\n",
    "| **Categories** | 5 (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech) |\n",
    "| **Data Source** | BBC News |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "This assignment will apply an **unsupervised approach, especially the matrix factorization method**, to discover topics in the news articles and use the labels to check the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Metric**: **Accuracy**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Maximize classification accuracy on the test set\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Aproached models\n",
    "- **1 (NMF)**\n",
    "- **2 (SVD/LSA)**\n",
    "- **3 (NMF + K-Means)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Resources\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Submission Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission file should contain:\n",
    "- **Header row**\n",
    "- **Two columns**:\n",
    "  - `ArticleId` (from Test File)\n",
    "  - `Category` (one of: sport, tech, business, entertainment, politics)\n",
