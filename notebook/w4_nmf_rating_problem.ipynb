    "# Movie Ratings Prediction using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "This project explores the application of **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** for predicting missing movie ratings and investigates the limitations of sklearn's NMF implementation compared to traditional recommender system approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "**Limitation(s) of sklearn's non-negative matrix factorization library** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1: NMF Implementation \n",
    "- Load the movie ratings dataset (from HW3-recommender-system)\n",
    "- Apply sklearn's Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) technique\n",
    "- Predict missing ratings from the test data\n",
    "- Measure prediction performance using **RMSE**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Critical Analysis \n",
    "- Analyze and discuss the results obtained from sklearn's NMF\n",
    "- Compare performance with baseline and similarity-based methods from Module 3\n",
    "- Identify why NMF may underperform compared to simpler approaches\n",
    "- Propose potential solutions and improvements to enhance NMF performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "-  [MovieLense](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) has currently 25 million user-movie ratings.  Since the entire data is too big, we use  a 1 million ratings subset [MovieLens 1M](https://www.kaggle.com/odedgolden/movielens-1m-dataset), and we reformatted the data to make it more convenient to use.\n",

    "### Why sklearn's NMF Underperforms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn's NMF performed poorly (RMSE: 2.5321) compared to similarity-based methods and even the simplest baselines for three primary reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different Objective:** NMF is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique optimized to minimize reconstruction error, not prediction error (RMSE). In contrast, similarity-based methods directly find similar users/items to predict unknown ratings, aligning better with the task's goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparsity Handling:** Sklearn's NMF is not inherently designed for the high sparsity of recommendation datasets. Replacing unrated entries (zeros) with a small value introduces noise and inaccurate information, leading to a less effective model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Fix It**\n",
    "- Use Specialized Algorithms: Instead of NMF, use matrix factorization algorithms designed for recommendation, such as SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) or ALS (Alternating Least Squares). These are optimized to predict missing ratings in sparse matrices. Libraries like Surprise provide efficient implementations.\n"
